Talking points

- Moore's law heuristic: 5yrs -> 10x, 10yrs -> 100x, more -> concierge
  - Sooner or later things which happen sooner or later happen

- Reassurance
 - Leon Fuerth, met in 2002, upset, wrote "Forward Engagement" in 2012
 - Lewis & Clark zone

- Extending trend lines
 - works pretty well considering lack of alternatives
 
- Nature abhors an asymptote
 - Sigmoids (s-curves), not singularities
 - Even black holes
 - I like Ray Kurzweil, but I wish he'd stop drawing half an S-curve

- D-list (delineation list, or characteristic list)
 - pattern: split off items that were usually grouped
 - 3 wishes with the evil genie
 - technology gives you more options to rearrage those lists
 - The d-list approach helps with rigorous analysis & measurements

- Definitions will get fuzzier
 - avoid easy fallback of "that's the law" or "our policy"
 - look for opportunities instead of debating terms
 - good samaritan
 - "a path forward" seems to add complexity by considering desires

- Draw two lines instead of one (also seems to add complexity)
 - printing money

- Conciege prototyping:
 - Step 1 to writing a program: step away from the computer
 - Sat nav prototype: programmer with a map
 - Big heath data prototype: assistant and expensive gadgets
 - Avoid big-company habit of operational efficiency
 - when calculating payoff, remember moore's law
 - file a patent even if the payoff is remote (need negotiating chips)

- Yes, you should file awful patents on obvious stuff
 - I hate them too, but play the game the way the game is played
 - sadly, there will be patents on every recording + application combo
 - you need negotiating chips for patent-sharing deals
 - (urinalysis, blood, etc) in {toilet, hand-held, etc) for (diabetes, etc)

- Exercise video games
 - 2k/yr
 - Madonna Proactive, Mr. Wilkenson

- Prevention = big payoff

- Home urinalysis

- Hudl 9 tabs
 - 10x improvement, go for the low-hanging fruit

- walking as example of big data diagnosis
 - will people be afraid to walk slower?
 - stress of feeling like being watched causes real harm
 - mutual transparency - know what's collected, in detail, by whom

- aggregation is a natural "winner take most" situation

- ins. companies cannot win vs. the big data aggregators (google, apple)

- only one way to keep power in check (split), all fit that pattern

- distributed algorithmic delineation
 - triangulation (inherent)

- how to regulate?
 - use transparency to separate recording from viewing
 - use the grandfather clause a lot (preserve ability to move away)
 
- exercises:
 - What's the low-hanging fruit for preventative medicine?
 - most expensive procedures - when could first be measured in principle?
 - exercise video games
 - start concierge tests right now
